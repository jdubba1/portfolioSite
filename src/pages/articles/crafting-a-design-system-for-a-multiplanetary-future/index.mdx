Getting a CMS like WordPress to work seamlessly with a modern javascript framework can be difficult, but may be the perfect solution if you only need custom functionality on a single page.

This project is currently live, and you can check it out [here.](http://goinfinitum.com/motor-selection)

*Try HP inputs between 3 and 15, and RPM inputs between 2000 and 4500.*

## The Problem

My Client for this project, [Infinitum](http://goinfinitum.com/), is a company that builds highly efficient electric motors.
They approached me looking for a simple tool which would recommend motors to the user based on input data. 
Initially, they were looking for some very basic functionality, and didn't want to link to an external site or alter their existing WordPress installation.

## Phase 1: WP CodeSnippets

To achieve the functionality my client sought after without altering their existing site, I decided to use the [CodeSnippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/) plugin to add a custom page template to their site.
By writing some javascript which scored motors by their relative distance from the user input, and writing *way* too much CSS, I was able to create a simple, single page application which would recommend motors to the user. 
Most of this CSS was written to override the default wordpress styles, and to make the page look more like the rest of the site.

## Phase 2: ReactPress

After the initial release of the tool, my client requested some additional functionality, including the ability to export motor recommendations as pdfs, and retrieve estimated efficiency data from a database.
At this point, I decided to rewrite the application in React, and to use the [ReactPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/reactpress/) plugin to render the React application on the page. 
This allowed me to use the same page template as before, and to keep the same URL, but to use React to handle the additional functionality. 
Furthermore, it made it possible to add css libraries like [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/) to the project, which made styling the application *much* easier.
